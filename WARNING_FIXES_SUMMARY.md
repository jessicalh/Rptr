# Warning Fixes Summary

All build warnings have been successfully resolved. Here's what was fixed:

## Round 2 - Additional Fixes ✅

### 1. statusBarOrientation Deprecation (iOS 13.0+)
- Replaced `[UIApplication sharedApplication].statusBarOrientation` with `self.view.window.windowScene.interfaceOrientation`
- Added iOS version check for compatibility

### 2. UI_USER_INTERFACE_IDIOM Deprecation (iOS 13.0+)
- Replaced `UI_USER_INTERFACE_IDIOM()` with `[UIDevice currentDevice].userInterfaceIdiom`

### 3. Format String Warning
- Fixed format specifier in HLSAssetWriterServer.m from `%d` to `%ld` for NSInteger

### 4. Deprecated Method Implementations
- Added `#pragma clang diagnostic` directives to suppress warnings for backwards-compatible methods
- Both `locationManager:didChangeAuthorizationStatus:` methods are kept for iOS 13 compatibility
- Added modern `locationManagerDidChangeAuthorization:` for iOS 14.0+
- Suppressed `shouldAutorotate` deprecation warning (needed for orientation control)

## Round 1 - Initial Fixes

### 1. App Icon Issues ✅
**Problem**: Missing icon files and incorrect icon dimensions
**Solution**: 
- Created all required app icons with camera + lightning bolt design
- Fixed icon dimensions (icons were being created at 2x the required size)
- All icons from 20x20 to 1024x1024 are now properly sized

## 2. Deprecated API Warnings ✅

### ViewController.m
- **devicesWithMediaType**: Replaced with `AVCaptureDeviceDiscoverySession`
- **videoOrientation**: Replaced with `videoRotationAngle` (iOS 17+)
- **isVideoOrientationSupported**: Replaced with `isVideoRotationAngleSupported:`
- **AVCaptureVideoOrientation**: Replaced with rotation angles (90° for landscape)
- **CLLocationManager authorizationStatus**: Changed from class method to instance method
- **CATransaction syntax**: Fixed from property access to method calls

### PermissionManager.m
- **CLLocationManager authorizationStatus**: Changed from deprecated class method to instance method on CLLocationManager instance

## 3. Format String Warning ✅
- **HLSAssetWriterServer.m**: Fixed NSInteger format by casting to `long` in line 1201

## Build Results
The project now builds cleanly with no warnings (except for the expected provisioning profile notice when building for simulator).

## Remaining Tasks
From the previous code review work:
1. Add comprehensive comments to ViewController.m
2. Add comprehensive comments to PermissionManager.m

All critical warnings have been resolved and the app is ready for testing.
